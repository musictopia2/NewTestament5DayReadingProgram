# NewTestament5DayReadingProgram
This is a web assembly app where it allows people to participate in a program to read through the entire new testament in one year by reading Monday through Friday

Installation Instructions:
None yet.

Known Issues:
Anybody on IPhone or IPad, if they don't go into this for 7 days, then any local storage stuff will be deleted.

Roadmap:

These are the things I want to accomplish:
 * Allow a way for users to keep track of their readings for the year
 * Allow a user to change their translation used
 * Once a reading has been completed for the day, will display a friendly message saying they already completed the reading.
 * Install as a PWA (progressive web app) so it works completely offline.


Here are my version plans:

#Version 1 (done)
 * will use a mock date and will just show the book and chapter that will be read. (Done)
 This will be the starting point to prove that its able to capture book and chapter for the day.
 If its Saturday or Sunday, will display a different message
 
 #Version 2 (done)
 * will actually show the reading but still for a mock date using the new king james version of the bible (Done)

 #Version 3 (done)
 * will allow somebody to change translation (done)
 * will save in local storage (at this point, for ios users, if they don't use this in 7 days, they will lose what translation chosen) (done)
 * still use mock dates (done)
 * allow to enter new dates to prove it will work into the future (done)

 #Version 4 (done)
 * will finally use real date
 * by this time, it is proven to work for all dates (even years into the future)

 #Version 5
 * will keep track of progress for the readings in local storage.
 
 by this time, this project will be completed.
 
 #Status:
 I am waiting to finish some projects.  Because I have a library which will be used for the readings.  However, I want to have the best possible performance so I am working  on source generators that may completely eliminate reflection from the library which is very slow.
