# NewTestament5DayReadingProgram
This is a web assembly app where it allows people to participate in a program to read through the entire new testament in one year by reading Monday through Friday

Installation Instructions:
None yet.

Known Issues:
Anybody on IPhone or IPad, if they don't go into this for 7 days, then any local storage stuff will be deleted.

Roadmap:

These are the things I want to accomplish:
 * Allow a way for users to keep track of their readings for the year
 * Allow a user to change their translation used
 * Once a reading has been completed for the day, will display a friendly message saying they already completed the reading.
 * Install as a PWA (progressive web app) so it works completely offline.
